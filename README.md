# Reporter #

This project aims to provide a user friendly environment to perform protein quantification based on reporter ions (iTRAQ, TMT).

Reporter assumes that the data has been processed by [PeptideShaker v0.41.1](http://genesis.ugent.be/maven2/eu/isas/peptideshaker/PeptideShaker/0.41.1/PeptideShaker-0.41.1.zip). _Note the version number!_
